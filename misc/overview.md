This training consists of:

- Part 1: an introductory 3-hour course on React using the
  `create-react-app` tool geared for JavaScript developers who have a
  good understanding of basic ES6 features. The course starts with a
  few slides and then dives into a live coding tutorial that learners
  can work through in sync with the instructor.

- Part 2: a 2-hour introduction on Redux using the React application
  that was built in Part 1 for JavaScript developers who understand
  the basics of ES6 and React and would like to learn state management
  with Redux. This part also uses live coding, and by its end,
  learners will have a working React + Redux application.

- Part 3: advanced topics that may be included based on learners'
  prior experience with JavaScript, React, and Redux.

Each part culminates in a fully functioning application, and while the
second uses the code built in the first, it can be used independently.
As well as React and Redux, learners will learn best practices for
building fast, scalable code.
